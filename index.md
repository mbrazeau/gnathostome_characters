## Early gnathostome characters matrix archive

This github project provides an archive of morphological characters, scores, and bibliographic information.
Morphological datasets are proliferating, which makes it difficult to track different branches created by individual research teams. 
This site represents an initial attempt to stem the tide by creating a model based in version control principles.
Investigators are invited to deploy version control tools (like git) to manage their phylogenetic data, providing an interface for recording incremental, transparent changes.
