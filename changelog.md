## Taxa added
*Ateleaspis tessellata*
*Kolymaspis sibirica*
*Minjinia turgenensis*

## Characters added

52. Crus commune: absent (0); present (1).

## Character modifications

- Three-layer exoskeleton decomposed into three characters (with absence/presence states): laminar basal layer, cancellous central layer, and dentinous external layer.

## Setting changes
Exclusions:
- Character 6 (three-layered exoskeleton). This has been extended into three separate characters.
- Character 56 (Dorsal ridge). This character has problematic characterisation and codings for placoderms. It is apparently present in taxa like *Romundina* and *Minjinia*, but the relevant areas in important taxa such as arthrodires are ambiguously presented. We therefore recommend better characterisation of such taxa before this character is re-included.

- Character 109 (Parachordal plates). This character is excluded from the analysis because its scirubg cannot be considered phenomenologically indistinct from the presence/absence of a metotic fissure.
