## Taxa added
*Ateleaspis tessellata*

*Kolymaspis sibirica*

*Minjinia turgenensis*

## Characters added or modified

- Three-layer exoskeleton decomposed into three characters (with absence/presence states): laminar basal layer, cancellous central layer, and dentinous external layer.

52. Crus commune: absent (0); present (1). [New character]

178. Neck joint facet modified to have three states: absent, ginglymoid, and reverse ginglymoid.

179. Para-articular process [New character]. Refers to the dermal process of the skull roof that forms a lateral margin on the craniothoracic joint.

180. Endoskeleal craniothoracic (sixth branchial) facet. [New character]. This homologises the open endoskeletal facet on the craniospinal process of *Kolymaspis* and *Brindabellaspis* wish the branchial facets of osteostracans.


## Setting changes
Exclusions:
- Character 6 (three-layered exoskeleton). This has been extended into three separate characters.
- Character 56 (Dorsal ridge). This character has problematic characterisation and codings for placoderms. It is apparently present in taxa like *Romundina* and *Minjinia*, but the relevant areas in important taxa such as arthrodires are ambiguously presented. We therefore recommend better characterisation of such taxa before this character is re-included.

- Character 109 (Parachordal plates). This character is excluded from the analysis because its scirubg cannot be considered phenomenologically indistinct from the presence/absence of a metotic fissure.
