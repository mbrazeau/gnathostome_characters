# gnathostome_characters
A database and interface for gnathostome characters

All character definitions, taxa, and the data matrix, as well as inclusion/exclusion settings and other character settings
are stored within the MATRIX_MASTER.nex file. This is the file you should use for phylogenetic analyses.

Users who wish to create their own version of the matrix should fork this repository and store their own version of it.
